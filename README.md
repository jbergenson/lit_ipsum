# Lit Ipsum
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/lit_ipsum.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/lit_ipsum)

This gem offers filler text from classical works of literature in place of standard "lorem ipsum" text. This can be useful for adding filler text for mockups and screenshots for new projects.

```bash
gem install lit_ipsum
```

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lit_ipsum', :git=> 'https://github.com/bergbergs/lit_ipsum.git', :branch => 'master'
```

And then require the gem whereever you plan to use it.

```ruby
require 'lit_ipsum'

LitIpsum::Austen::PrideAndPrejudice.sentences(3) #=> "Other schemes, too, came into her head. As often as I can. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham."
LitIpsum::Austen::PrideAndPrejudice.words(7)     #=> "Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me."

LitIpsum::Doyle::SherlockHolmes.sentences(2)     #=> "And how in the world did you find them? It is half-past ten now."
LitIpsum::Doyle::SherlockHolmes.words(5)         #=> "Yes, it did. Get out!"

LitIpsum::Austen::PrideAndPrejudice.sentences(3, repeat: 2)
